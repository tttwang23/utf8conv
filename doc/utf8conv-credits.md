utf8conv credits
===

The design of the parser was inspired by [nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom).

The design of the finite state machine used by utf8conv was based on a technical design article written by [Henri Sivonen](https://hsivonen.fi/broken-utf-8/).

The structure of the iterator loop was based on a suggestion by user quindot on [Rust-lang.org](https://users.rust-lang.org/).
